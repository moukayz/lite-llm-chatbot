# API Integration

This application uses OpenAI-compatible APIs for AI chat functionality.

## API Compatibility

- The application is currently set up to use Dashscope (Alibaba Cloud's AI service) with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- It uses the OpenAI JS SDK but with a custom `baseURL` pointing to Dashscope

## Key Code

In [app/api/chat/route.ts](mdc:lite-llm-chatbot/app/api/chat/route.ts):

```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: config.dashscopeApiKey,
  baseURL: "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
});
```

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
- `DASH_SCOPE_API_KEY` - API key for Dashscope
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, if you want to switch to OpenAI

## Model Configuration

Current configuration uses:
- Model: `qwen-plus` (Alibaba's model)
- Temperature: 0.7
- Max tokens: 500
