# TypeScript Types

This application uses TypeScript to provide type safety across the codebase.

## Core Types

The main types used in the application include:

- Message types for chat interactions
- Configuration types for API settings
- UI state types for component props

## Type Definitions

### Message Types

Message types are defined in the types directory and used throughout the application to ensure consistent data structure for chat messages.

Key type interfaces:
- `Message` - Represents a single chat message
- `ChatState` - Represents the entire chat state including message history
- `ApiConfig` - Configuration for API connections

## Type Usage

Types are used consistently across:
- Component props
- State management
- API request/response handling
- Configuration objects

## Best Practices

When extending the application:
1. Create new type definitions in the `app/types` directory
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for complex object structures
3. Use type unions for values with multiple possible types
4. Leverage TypeScript's utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial) where appropriate
